<!-- more -->

A web app developed between David Kunz, Brayden Stone, and I in a month and a half for USU's software engineering course. Askr is a full featured live survey app akin to Kahoot, but will allow for new answers in the middle of a survey, as well as having the choice of questions types such as survey or correct answer system.
