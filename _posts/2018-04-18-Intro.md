making this blg was something i was not looking forward to. It isn't hard by any means, but it took time, time that I would have rather put towards the projects that will slowly populate this website.But as a college student nearing the end of my third year of computer science, I realized I couldn't just make projects on the side. I needed to have somewhere that explained, described, and gave basic instructions for the projects finished, while giving updates on upcoming releases.
Taking these needs into account, I created this blog as a companion to the repositories found on my github page.

This Blog will also have more run of the mill long form Tech blog posts, as well as posts focused on music reccomendations and playlists, a hobby that I am currently humoring as a board member of the local college radio station.

Each blog post focusing on a project will denote the language, libraries, and anything else of note used in the development of the project.

Any code that is of interest within the project will also be displayed like the following:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Ian')
#=> prints 'Hi, Ian' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
